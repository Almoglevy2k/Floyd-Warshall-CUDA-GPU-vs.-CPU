## Algorithm Explanation

### CPU Algorithm: Sequential Scan
- **Approach:**
  - The CPU iterates through each element of the array.
  - It keeps track of the smallest value found during the iteration.
- **Complexity:**
  - The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements.
  - Every element is checked sequentially.

### GPU Algorithm: Parallel Reduction
- **Approach:**
  - The GPU uses a parallel reduction technique to find the minimum:
    - **Pairwise Comparison:**  
      Threads compare pairs of elements simultaneously.
    - **Reduction Steps:**  
      In each step, the number of elements is halved as each thread outputs the smaller of two compared values.
    - **Iterations:**  
      These steps repeat until only one value remains â€“ the minimum.
- **Complexity:**
  - The reduction runs in approximately O(log n) parallel steps.
  - This is significantly faster than the sequential CPU for the core computation, given enough GPU cores.
- **Overhead Considerations:**
  - While the GPU computation itself is fast, overall performance includes overhead from:
    - Memory allocation.
    - Data transfers.
    - Kernel launch latency.
